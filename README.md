# covid19_team2 MDP Research
## Remote Branch on MDP development related to Covid-19 Death/Cases predictions only

Actionable Prediction of cases and deaths related to Covid-19 in the United States using a Markov Decision Process based learning algorithm.

## Current Improvements (Development)
- Multiprocessing
- GridSearch 
- Action learning
- Cross-validation Modes "TIME_CV", "ID", "ALL"

## Working improvements (Development)
- Action threshold definition (preprocessing features)
- Completion of the transition matrix
- Cross validation including more data (exponentially weighted predicitions)
